 desc_harpy_seek_precedent: "Each fledgling first soaring from their nest thinks themself a matriarch. When the Riaveltu’s quavering voice calls out the ancient tales to the mountain peaks, we hear a terrible truth in the echo: every flight is a potential fall. Ivelá is betrayed by their harem and thrown from the Mournful Rock; Hirér goes undefeated, only to perish from a sickness their armies helped spread. The stories guide and guard us, and we ignore them to our peril.\n\nSo goes the first lesson: maintain humility upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nGain §G1§! Stability.\nChoose between §G-2.00§! National Unrest and §G+2%§! Missionary Strength for §Y10§! years."
 desc_harpy_seek_conflict: "Fear not the swell of the wind on the plain! Fear not the thrill of battle! Paint yourself with the fury of the nest-robbed, whose shrieks tear open the fabric of the sky. As the regiment Riaveltu sings the eagle hymn, we remember once more our talons. We remember how to swoop and to tear.\n\nSo goes the second lesson: remember fury upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nGain §G0.6§! years of manpower.\nGain '§YSeeking Conflict§!' for §Y5§! years, giving §G+15.0%§! Morale Damage.\nIf following the §YEagle§! Doctrine, instead gain §G0.8§! years of manpower and §G+20.0%§! Morale Damage."
 desc_harpy_seek_prosperity: "Each flies their own path, each seeks their own fortune. Let weaklings in the foothills attempt to bully away the innate desire for one’s own ends. Instead, we offer the ambitious and wealthy that which their money and possessions cannot buy; civic clout. Each of their feather-ends dipped in dyes of gold and ochre, the prestigious compete in public displays of generosity, gilding every nest. From their scattered coins is built a nation.\n\nSo goes the third lesson: find opportunity upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nGain '§YSeeking Prosperity§!' for §Y10§! years, giving §G+10.0%§! National Tax Modifier and §G+10.0%§! Income from Vassals.\nGain §G50§! Crowns per §Y100§! combined Development of you plus your non-tributary subjects.\nIf following the §YCrane§! Doctrine, gain an additional §G25§! Crowns per §Y100§! combined Development."
 desc_harpy_seek_glory: "An army is ten thousand desires, jutting in conflicting directions like back-combed feathers after rain. Such desires must be channelled, lest the army fragment as the flock before a storm, but an army of brawlers is a liability itself. This is the origin of the harpy spar, the discipline of competitive single combat. Those who fail learn humility; those who prevail prove themselves the finest and most resilient of us.\n\nSo goes the fourth lesson: show tenacity upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nGain '§YSeeking Glory§!' for §Y10§! years, giving §G+15.0%§! Manpower Recovery Speed.\nRandomly gain a §YPowerful General§! from several options.\nIf following the §YEagle§! Doctrine, gain increased chances of a better General."
 desc_harpy_seek_support: "What does the prey care for your pride? Set it aside, breathe the calming incense and step through the beaded door into the negotiation room. The wise matriarch retains great respect for these rituals of peace, which allow us to look our rivals in the face and read their intent. Two hunts may lead to the same end; two desires may feed one another. Only a fool discards such opportunities.\n\nSo goes the fifth lesson: choose friends carefully upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nLose §G10§! Aggressive Expansion.\nGain '§YSeeking Support§!' for §Y10§! years, giving §G+20.0%§! Improve Relations and §G-10.0%§! Subject Liberty Desire.\nIf following the §YMyna§! Doctrine, instead lose §G20§! Aggressive Expansion."
 desc_harpy_seek_clarity: "What do you Hunt? Do you even know? No strength of character, no true self-knowledge, is achieved without conflict and challenge. Strike out, young harpy, and learn yourself against the world. Perhaps you will find you are weaker than you thought, but even this is knowledge you can use. When the time comes for you to be truly tested, you will know when to dodge the blow and when to strike.\n\nSo goes the sixth lesson: know yourself upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nChoose between gaining §G50§! Administrative, Diplomatic, or Military Power and gain §G+1§! in the Heir's corresponding Skill.\nIf following the §YCrane§! Doctrine, instead gain §G+2§!."
 desc_harpy_seek_what_you_will: "Mistake not the disapproval of your Matriarch for the disapproval of the Hunt, for the Hunt is not a parent or a priest. The beauty of our ancient way is its acknowledgement, near-unique in this world, of the ambition and desire of individual souls. The eccentrics who waste their lives for esoteric ends are quick to invite scorn - theirs are the so-called “Odd Hunts’’, their motives strange and nonsensical. But take heed; more often than not, it is the Odd Hunters who change the world.\n\nSo goes the secret lesson: endure misunderstanding upon the Hunt.\n--------------\nGain '§YSeeking What You Will§!' for §Y10§! years, giving §G-5.0%§! Technology Cost and §G-5.0%§! Idea Cost.\nGain §G20§! progress towards the next insitution in all provinces with a §YHarpy Roost§!.\nIf following the §YMyna§! Doctrine, instead gain §G-10%§! Idea Cost and §G30§! progress towards the next insitution in all provinces with a §YHarpy Roost§!."
