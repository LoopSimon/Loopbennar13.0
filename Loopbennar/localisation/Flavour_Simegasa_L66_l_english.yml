 simegasa_events.1.t: "A Price To Be Paid"
 simegasa_events.1.d: "The sun sets over the city of Simegasfan. Dejen stands upon the balcony of his palace, exhausted and tired. In his 34 years of life in this realm, he has faced multiple assassinations, dark rituals, acts of terror, and worse…\n\nUnder the influence of certain courtiers and a night spent sleeping under the Dhagismuk tree, he converted at a young age to the ancient faith of pre-Melakmengi Simegasa, the Shadowpact - a faith based on venerating the dark beings of the Shadowrealm. It was purged long ago by Zenidir Zentirizar and his acolytes, enforcing the worship of Amilak and the sky, driving its believers underground. Now, Simegasa has returned to the faith of its ancestors, although the legacy of a millennia of suppression will be hard to erase.\n\nIn 1443 Dejen made a deal with the hags of the Yezel Mora, and with their aid he brought Simegasa to its current strength. Yet he never found out what the price would be for their aid.\n\nAs the sun finally slips beneath the horizon, a shadowy ghost creeps up behind him. Dejen notices, but he is not alarmed, for this is not his first encounter with such beings.\n\nIn a steeled voice he questions the ghost, "So, what price will I pay?"\n\nThe shadow smiles, and responds, "As without me your victory was beyond hope, I only require the lands you’ve conquered with my help. A clever man like yourself will do what you're told, won't you?"\n\nWith that, the ghost dissipated and Dejen was left alone to ponder his options. In the end he must make a decision, and so he decides to…"
 simegasa_events.1.a: "Pay the price."
 simegasa_events.1.b: "Refuse, and face the consequences."

 simegasa_events.2.t: "Wrath of the Righteous"
 simegasa_events.2.d: "Amru, the last scion of the ancient zor Yiwah-Yafet family, has led a quiet existence in his 19 years of life. Though his name is prestigious, and he himself is a prodigious mage of great potential, he never tried to use his abilities for real power, instead preferring to be a "mere" court mage serving as an advisor to the king of Matamot.\n\nAnd then one day, a large delegation of nobles from Simegasa visited the court of Matamot, and brought with them a crown, offering it to Amru. The young man, filled with potential as a battlemage, was persuaded by those around him to take the offer. On that day, he was no longer just Amru the court Mage, but Amru IV zor Yiwah-Yafet, the final descendant of the legendary conqueror of old, and the righteous warrior of Amilak.\n\nNow Amru and the nobles of Simegasa have made their move, seizing the city of Mewojala and declaring a holy war against the "servants of evil and shadow that squat in Simegasfan".\n\nWith the secession of Mewojala also went much of the army and most of the Simegasan nobility. Dejen's cry for aid from the shadow-coven has been met with silence, forcing the Mezhi to handle this crisis himself. Should Dejen win, then the project of converting Simegasa to the ways of the shadow will be complete, but should Amru succeed in his righteous fight, then the shadowpact will be purged and a new kingdom will re-emerge in western Madriamilak…"
 simegasa_events.2.a: "To Simegasfan we ride! Destroy the shadow cultists!"
 simegasa_events.2.b: "Gather the shadow priests and the army, we leave for Mewojala by nightfall."

 simegasa_events.3.t: "Revenge of the Righteous"
 simegasa_events.3.d: "Amru stares at the enemy leader as the former Mezhi of Simegasa is nailed to the cross. He seals the enemy's mouth shut, so he cannot scream, before moving on to more important matters. In the coming days, the rivers and roads of Mewojala were lined with crosses, upon them rests the dead and dying shadow-priests and soldiers of Simegasfan, a grim reminder of what awaited those that side with Yrilak and evil.\n\nThe brief attempt of establishing a realm of shadow within the holy land has failed, another victory of Amilak over Yrilak. Yet for the neighboring kingdoms, all is not well, for a kingdom ruled by a powerful, now experienced battlemage has taken Simegasa's place. The question on the minds of nearby kings is one of fear and worry, for they wonder if Amru will stop at just Simegasa. Amru has portrayed himself in propaganda as the second coming of the witch-king from all those centuries ago, and who's to doubt him?\n\nBut for the common man in Simegasa, none of this matters. Much of the population reluctantly followed their king in the conversion to the pact of shadows, and as soon as crosses started appearing along the roads, the people returned to the faith in Amilak, as the sky-priests returned to their temples they had been in for centuries. With time, none will remember when this land was ruled by cultists, and Dejen will become a mere historical curiosity, a great "what if?"."

 simegasa_events.4.t: "The Blackburned Martyr"
 simegasa_events.4.d: "Within the center of Simegasfan, just outside the palace, a large crowd gathers. 113 prisoners have been chained to the ground with a magic circle placed underneath each of them. As they activate, the prisoners are transformed, their souls corrupted, now no longer human, but instead have become various monsters of the shadow plane. Their minds have been manipulated, now obedient to their master, the Mezhi of Simegasa.\n\nBut Amru is not among them. He instead is forced to watch, from a distance as his former comrades are turned into something he does not recognize. As the monsters are led away, the crowd turns their attention to Amru, as a series of spells are cast, along with a ritual prepared by the night hags.\n\nAmru is set on fire, a black flame consuming him. But he does not die, as all damage dealt to him is continually regenerated, forcing him to suffer in permanent agony. Over the weeks that follow, his mind slips away, until nothing is left but an empty husk of what was once Amru. The night hags take the husk with them to the shadow plane, pleased with the new magically-gifted servant they have received from Simegasa.\n\nAs the news spreads of what occurred in Simegasfan, the resistance in Mewojala ends, as people retreat to their villages and try to return to their lives. The shadow has triumphed over the sky, as the forces of Yrilak have claimed a realm of their own within the holy land."
